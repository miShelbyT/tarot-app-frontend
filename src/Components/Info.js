        The standard tarot deck has 78 cards, and each one has its own imagery and symbolism. The cards are split into two categories: 22 Major Arcana cards and 56 Minor Arcana cards. The Major Arcana tarot cards depict significant events in the life journey while the minor arcana are for the small details and happenings.

      <p>Understanding the general meaning of each card is just the beginning. The real power comes in using the cards to tap into your own intuition and wisdom so you can start taking positive steps into a brighter future. Generally, a tarot card reading follows a simple format. First, you need to ask the card deck a question, which should be clear and open-ended. For example, avoid asking questions that begin with "Will I...," as they run the risk of locking you into a passive role in your own future. The idea is to use the card reading to illuminate a path forward, so ask questions that are more broad. Here are a few frameworks to consider if you're new to tarot:
            </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          "What do I need to know about...?"
                </li>
        <li>
          "How can I understand...?"
                </li>
        <li>
          "Why am I feeling anxious about...?"
                </li>
        <li>
          "Where is the hidden opportunity in...?"
                </li>
        <li>
          "What should I focus on in my relationship with...?"
                </li>
        <li>
          "How can I move past...?"
                </li>
      </ul>

      <p>Each Drawn card will represent a different aspect of you, your life, or the situation you are asking about. In our app the meanings are as follows:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>

                </li>
        <li>
          The second card represents past events that have led to the current situation
                </li>
        <li>
          The third card represents events or energy that the future holds if things continue as they are
                </li>
        <li>
          The fourth card represents the most dominant thoughts and energy in your conscious mind and how they may affect the situation
                </li>
        <li>
          The fifth card represents subconscious thoughts and energy that drive the situation, in someties unexpected ways

                </li>

      </ul>
